# todolist_redux_mobx_RN
a simple demo for redux&mobx in RN.
The demo is built by redux in react first.
(http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/ExampleTodoList.html)
I rebuild it by redux or mobx for react native.

## run demo
1. git clone or download the demo project to local
2. run `npm install`
3. run `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`
##### PS: the script need dev environment for RN.

## change mobx or redux 
 In the file ./index.android.js or ./index.ios.js 
 `AppRegistry.registerComponent('todolist_redux_mobx', () => AppRedux)`
 You can change AppRedux to AppMobx to see the demo built by Mobx.
